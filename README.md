- **Adobe CS3 & Macromedia Flash 8:** 2D animation and content creation  

### 🌱 Currently Learning
- Advanced Excel and practical data storytelling  
- More Python and Java for applied projects  
- How to build creative and useful portfolio projects

### 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on

### ⚡ Fun fact
When I’m not coding or analyzing data, I’m animating funny or expressive 2D stories.  
I love mixing creativity, logic, and storytelling to build things that teach, entertain, or inspire.
